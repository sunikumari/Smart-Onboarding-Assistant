**Theme**: Developer Productivity / AI

## Problem Statement
Onboarding to a new task or repo is time-consuming and often lacks context. Engineers spend hours figuring out what the task is, where the relevant files are, and how the code flows.

## Solution
Build an AI-powered agent that accelerates onboarding by:
- Automatically assigning tasks based on role or team.
- Fetching relevant files from Code Repository.
- Generating a code flow summary to explain the task and its impact.
- Providing coding suggestions using GitHub Copilot.
